# react-custom-hooks

A set of useful custom react hooks.

### Problem

Writing applications requires using similar code
over and over again. Partially we cover it using libraries,
but some elements we write in every project. For example
maintaining state of modal windows, opened menus, changed
form fields.

### Solution

This package gathers already existing hooks which were used
in many projects.
